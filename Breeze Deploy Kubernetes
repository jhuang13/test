during deployment, below issues encountered
1. When deploy Docker, the resolve.conf is set to default by NetworkManager. dns down for hosts.
2. chronyd is needed for the deployment, but it is missing. need to use yum to install on each hosts.
3. so we need to modify the resolve.conf to add in the DNS servers and use yum to install chrony.
4. if we are only deploy single master. the API server entry point port is 6443. if we are deploy cluster of master using haproxy. the entry point port is 6444.
=============================
for Harbor server login from docker client:
docker login x.x.x.x
but need to got to /etc/docker/daemon.json and add below, then restart docker on the client
{ "insecure-registries":["192.168.33.10"] }
