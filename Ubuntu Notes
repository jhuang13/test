This command lists the Application Name, PID, User, IP version, Device ID and the Node with Port Name. It shows both TCP and UDP.

Variations :

To format it in a nice, readable way; use :

sudo lsof -i -n -P | more

To view view only TCP connections :

sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep TCP | more

To view view only UDP connections :

sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep UDP | more

Do the command

sudo update-rc.d minidlna enable
